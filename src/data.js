      "Samsung's brand new Galaxy S7 is a subtle improvement over its predecessor on the outside, but a whole new beast on the inside. Powered by the Exynos 8890 SoC, this phone can blaze through absolutely anything you throw at it, with power to spare. The camera is absolutely amazing, especially in low light. This is a pragmatic phone, compared to its sibling the Galaxy S7 Edge, and is better value for money if you don't want to show off. However, with competition at an all-time high, you can also get most of its features and functions for one third this price.",

    info:
      "The HTC 10 is a beautifully crafted smartphone with a gorgeous display and an ergonomic design. This phone is the first to have optical image stabilisation for the front facing camera, which does help when shooting in low light. The phone has very snappy performance thanks to the Snapdragon 820 SoC, 4GB of RAM and 32GB of onboard storage. The USB Type-C port gets USB 3.1 Gen 1 speeds for faster data transfers. Sense UI is now leaner than ever, with many of the custom apps traded in favour of Google's native apps. Camera performance is good thanks to the 12 Ultrapixel 2 sensor, OIS and laser autofocus. The built-in battery lasts an entire day but doesn't do too well if you watch a lot of videos. Overall, the HTC 10 is a solid flagship that can go toe-to-toe with the best in the business.",

      "The iPhone 12 mini fills a void in the market, and many people looking for a compact flagship-level phone will be pleased with it. This model could be a suitable upgrade for those holding on to older iPhones because they like the size. You get nearly all the same flagship specifications as with the iPhone 12, with the exception of a smaller battery and slower wireless charging. The display is smaller but just as dense, and quality is excellent. Performance is also great, though this phone does get a bit warm when stressed. The iPhone 12 mini can take brilliant photos in the daytime and at night with both its rear cameras and the front one as well. Night mode is supported across all cameras. Games and movies aren't especially engrossing on the smaller screen but the iPhone 12 mini will do for casual everyday use. iOS 14 is slick and smooth, and you get guaranteed updates for several years",

It uses a 6.7-inch LTPO OLED display which the company claims cuts power consumption by up to 50 percent compared to the previous model. It's powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 SoC, and is available in two varaints. I was happy with the accuracy of the in-display fingerprint sensor, and I also like the fact that the edges of the display are slightly less curved compared to the OnePlus 8 Pro, which helps in preventing accidental touches.",

The size is both bigger and heavier than its predecessor, making it one of the heaviest phones we've held in a while, measuring 9.48mm and weighing a whopping 240g. Face recognition is a lot quicker and works at odd angles too. The 6.59-inch AMOLED display has a full-HD+ resolution but what's impressive is that it has a 120Hz refresh rate. The ROG Phone 2 also features the second version of Asus's AirTrigger system. There is a new dual vibration system present too. The phone also uses a 3D vapour chamber system for cooling. ",
